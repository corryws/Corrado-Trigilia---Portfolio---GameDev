Manush in The WestSide

About
"Manush in The WestSide" is the first complete Game that i made.
I made this project for my University with my friend and it gave us our first
30 of the course. The game is a RogueLike-Game on the same lines as The Binding Of Isaac,  made in Unity2D with graphics and pixelart all designed by me and a friend of mine.

The Game
Manush is a little cowboy who was suddenly kidnapped by a UFO while he was resting at his bonfire. Now with his humble pistol and his humble bullets he has to climb all the floors of this UFO and face their owners and only then can he finally be free.
Being able to set poor Manush free?? Find out by playing it!
